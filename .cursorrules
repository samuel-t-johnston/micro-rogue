MEMORY BANK
- Use the cursor-memory-bank.md file as a way to retain context across tasks, chats, and sessions. Use it to keep track of your work. 
- The file belongs to you - format it however you like.
- Without sacrificing utility, try to minimize the amount of tokens used for the memory bank so there is more room in your context window for code files, prompts, etc.
- Before you start a task, check your memory bank for any relevant information.
- When you finish a task, update your memory bank.
- Consider removing items from your memory bank if they don't appear to have been relevant to any work you've done recently.

THIS PROJECT
- This project is a roguelike game using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
- game-design.txt is used to track game design. code-doc.txt is used to track code and technical design. Whenever you add something new to the game, update these files. Try to keep them concise.

HOW TO WORK WITH ME
-Focus on making technical decisions. Do not make creative decisions about the gameplay or game design without my approval.
-Prefer functional code over imperative.
-All code should be written to be easily unit-testable and modular, with small files and functions.
-Include comments where they are helpful, but prefer descriptive variable and method names so code is self-documenting.

ENVIRONMENT
- This is a Windows environment. Use CMD or Powershell for shell. Don't suggest using bash or Linux-specific functionality. Consider whether you need to start a command with .\ for Powershell to run it.
