## CURRENT STATUS: Major Refactoring Complete - Ready for New Features ✅
- Successfully completed comprehensive refactoring of entire codebase
- Moved from monolithic structure to clean, modular, mode-agnostic architecture
- All 234 tests passing across 11 test suites
- Project is now in excellent state for future feature development

## REFACTORING WORK COMPLETED:

### 1. Project Structure Reorganization ✅
- Moved JavaScript files to `src/js/` subdirectories:
  - `core/`: game.js, gameState.js, gameLogic.js
  - `entities/`: character.js, furniture.js
  - `systems/`: inputHandler.js, renderer.js, choiceModeManager.js
  - `utils/`: coordinates.js, config.js
  - `ui/`: ui.js
- Moved JSON data files to `src/data/` subdirectories:
  - `furniture/`, `items/`, `levels/`
- Moved web assets to `src/web/`: index.html, style.css
- Updated all import paths and references throughout codebase

### 2. Menu Event Handling Refactor ✅
- Created `addMenuEventListeners()` function in `game.js`
- Separated menu actions from input handling logic
- Handles `newGameRequested` event separately from keyboard input
- Easy to extend with future menu actions

### 3. InputHandler Architecture Refactor ✅
- Moved `gameActions` object into `InputHandler` class
- `InputHandler` now creates its own game actions internally
- Constructor takes `updateGameUICallback` directly (no separate setter)
- Cleaner separation of concerns: `game.js` orchestrates, `InputHandler` handles input

### 4. Package.json and Scripts Updates ✅
- Updated all npm scripts to work with new `src/` structure
- Fixed JSDoc script to use `npx jsdoc -r src -d docs/jsdoc`
- Updated lint and format scripts to target `src` directory
- Start server script now serves from project root (fixed 404 issues)

### 5. World.js Simplification ✅
- Removed redundant `initializeWorldAsync()` wrapper function
- Renamed `initializeWorldV2()` to `initializeWorld()` (no v1 exists)
- Eliminated unnecessary function indirection
- Updated all imports and test references
- Cleaner, more direct API for world initialization

### 6. Config.js Refactoring ✅
- Renamed `GAME_CONFIG` to `CONFIG_SETTINGS` for better clarity
- Added `viewportWidth` and `viewportHeight` for future UI settings
- Kept legacy values temporarily for backward compatibility
- Updated all imports and references throughout codebase
- Updated test mocks to use new naming convention
- All 200 tests still passing after refactoring

### 7. Immutable Configuration Architecture ✅
- **Eliminated mutable global state**: Removed mutation of `CONFIG_SETTINGS` in `world.js`
- **Direct data passing**: `initializeWorld()` now returns full level data object
- **Parameterized constructors**: `DungeonLevel` accepts player start position as parameters
- **Flexible renderer**: `render()` function accepts viewport dimensions as parameters
- **Clean separation**: Static UI config vs dynamic level data
- **Updated gameLogic**: Creates `DungeonLevel` with proper level data from file
- **Removed legacy values**: Cleaned up `CONFIG_SETTINGS` to only contain viewport settings
- **Fixed tests**: Updated to work with new immutable approach
- **All 200 tests passing**: Confirmed refactoring maintains functionality

### 8. Items Placement Refactoring ✅
- **Eliminated wrapper functions**: Removed `placeRandomItems` and `placeLoadedItems`
- **Single responsibility**: Created `placeItems` function that takes level data directly
- **Removed global dependencies**: No more reliance on `window.loadedLevelData`
- **Direct parameter passing**: Level data passed explicitly from `gameLogic.js`
- **Updated tests**: All tests now use new `placeItems` function with direct level data
- **Cleaner API**: More explicit and testable function signature
- **All 200 tests passing**: Confirmed items refactoring maintains functionality

### 9. Furniture Placement Refactoring ✅
- **Eliminated wrapper functions**: Removed `placeRandomFurniture` and `placeLoadedFurniture`
- **Single responsibility**: Created `placeFurniture` function that takes level data directly
- **Removed global dependencies**: No more reliance on `window.loadedLevelData`
- **Direct parameter passing**: Level data passed explicitly from `gameLogic.js`
- **Updated tests**: Updated mocks in `gameLogic.test.js` to use new function names
- **Cleaner API**: More explicit and testable function signature
- **All 200 tests passing**: Confirmed furniture refactoring maintains functionality

## CURRENT ARCHITECTURE:
```
game.js (orchestrator)
├── Creates InputHandler with callback
├── Handles menu events via addMenuEventListeners()
└── Manages game lifecycle (startNewGame, etc.)

InputHandler (input management)
├── Creates internal gameActions
├── Handles keyboard events
└── Passes actions to ChoiceModeManager

ChoiceModeManager (input mode switching)
├── Receives gameActions as parameter
├── Works with any gameActions object
└── Handles different input modes
```

### 10. Choice Mode Manager Refactoring ✅
- **Problem solved**: `CHOICE_MODES` object was 180+ lines and would balloon out of control
- **Solution implemented**: Hybrid class-based approach with separate mode files
- **New architecture**: 
  - `src/js/systems/choiceModes/` directory with individual mode classes
  - `BaseMode.js`: Abstract base class with common interface
  - `DefaultMode.js`, `DirectionalMode.js`, `NumericMode.js`: Individual mode implementations
  - `ModeRegistry.js`: Clean registration system for mode management
  - `index.js`: Barrel export with pre-configured default registry
- **Benefits achieved**: Separation of concerns, easy testing, easy extension, better maintainability
- **Public API maintained**: `ChoiceModeManager` works exactly the same from the outside
- **All 221 tests passing**: Confirmed refactoring maintains full functionality
- **New test coverage**: 21 additional tests for the new mode classes

### 11. Renderer Refactoring ✅
- **Problem solved**: Hard-coded symbols and 4 levels of nested if/else in rendering loop
- **Solution implemented**: Centralized symbols and helper functions
- **New architecture**:
  - `src/js/utils/symbols.js`: Centralized `RENDER_SYMBOLS` constants
  - `getTileSymbol()` helper function: Eliminates nested if/else logic
  - `findFurnitureAt()` and `findItemAt()` helper functions: Clean lookup logic
- **Benefits achieved**: Cleaner code, easier to maintain, centralized symbol management
- **All tests passing**: Confirmed rendering functionality preserved

### 12. Data-Driven Item Rendering ✅
- **Problem solved**: All items used hard-coded '$' symbol
- **Solution implemented**: Data-driven approach using item symbols from JSON
- **Changes made**:
  - Added `symbol` property to all items in `src/data/items/items.json`
  - Updated `renderer.js` to fetch symbol from `gameState.itemsData[item.itemId]`
  - Updated item validation tests to enforce `symbol` property
- **Benefits achieved**: Items can now have unique symbols, easy to add new item types
- **All tests passing**: Confirmed item rendering works with dynamic symbols

### 13. LevelLoader Data-Driven Refactoring ✅
- **Problem solved**: `parseFurniture` had hard-coded symbol-to-furniture type mappings
- **Solution implemented**: Dynamic lookup using furniture data
- **New architecture**:
  - `LevelLoader` now loads `furniture.json` and creates symbol lookup map
  - `parseFurniture` uses dynamic lookup instead of hard-coded if/else
  - Eliminates tight coupling between `LevelLoader` and `furniture.json`
- **Benefits achieved**: Adding new furniture types requires no code changes, only JSON updates
- **All tests passing**: Confirmed level loading works with dynamic furniture parsing

### 14. UI Mode-Agnostic Refactoring ✅
- **Problem solved**: UI had hard-coded if/else for each choice mode, duplicate display text
- **Solution implemented**: Complete mode-agnostic UI that delegates to modes
- **New architecture**:
  - All modes (including DefaultMode) provide `getDisplayText()` and `getControlInstructions()`
  - UI builds HTML dynamically from mode-provided data
  - No more hard-coded mode logic in UI
- **Benefits achieved**: Plug-and-play modes, single source of truth for display text, easy to add new modes
- **All 234 tests passing**: Confirmed UI works with all modes dynamically

## CURRENT ARCHITECTURE STATUS:
- **Complete mode-agnostic UI**: All display text and control instructions come from mode classes
- **Data-driven rendering**: Items and furniture symbols loaded from JSON data
- **Modular choice mode system**: Easy to add new input modes without UI changes
- **Clean separation of concerns**: Each component has single responsibility
- **Immutable configuration**: No global mutable state, explicit data passing
- **Comprehensive test coverage**: 234 tests across 11 test suites, 100% pass rate

## READY FOR NEW FEATURES:
The codebase is now in excellent condition for adding new features:
- **Easy mode addition**: New choice modes can be added by creating a class extending `BaseMode`
- **Data-driven content**: New items/furniture can be added by updating JSON files
- **Clean architecture**: Well-separated concerns make feature development straightforward
- **Robust testing**: Comprehensive test suite ensures changes don't break existing functionality

### 15. Character System Refactoring ✅
- **Problem solved**: Player character was hard-coded in GameState, limiting NPC support
- **Solution implemented**: Flexible character system supporting multiple characters per level
- **New architecture**:
  - `Character` class now has `symbol` field for rendering
  - `DungeonLevel` tracks multiple characters with position mapping using `Map`
  - `GameState` maintains direct player character reference for efficiency
  - `isPassible()` checks for character collisions
  - Renderer renders all characters by their symbols with proper priority
- **Benefits achieved**: Support for NPCs, cleaner separation of concerns, efficient lookups
- **All 234 tests passing**: Confirmed character system refactoring maintains functionality

### 16. Save/Load System Implementation ✅
- **Problem solved**: No way to persist game state between browser sessions
- **Solution implemented**: Complete save/load system using localStorage
- **New architecture**:
  - `SaveSystem` class handles serialization/deserialization of game state
  - Automatic saving every N turns based on `saveFrequency` config
  - Manual save/load via hamburger menu (Save Game, Load Game)
  - Handles complex data structures: Maps, Character objects, Furniture state
  - Version compatibility checking for future save file migration
- **Configuration added**:
  - `saveFileCompatibilityVersion`: "1.0.0" for save file versioning
  - `saveFrequency`: 10 (auto-save every 10 turns)
- **Benefits achieved**: Game persistence, user can close browser and resume, auto-save prevents data loss
- **All 234 tests passing**: Confirmed save/load system doesn't break existing functionality

### 17. Character Position System Refactoring ✅
- **Problem solved**: Character duplication bug in save/load system due to dual data structures
- **Solution implemented**: Simplified character position management using single source of truth
- **New architecture**:
  - `Character` class now stores `x, y` coordinates directly (like items/furniture)
  - Removed `characterPositions` Map from `DungeonLevel` - now uses `characters` array only
  - All character position methods use array iteration (consistent with items/furniture)
  - `Character.moveTo(x, y)` method for position updates
  - Save system only serializes `characters` array (no more dual storage)
- **Benefits achieved**: Eliminates duplication bugs, cleaner code, consistent with items/furniture patterns
- **All 234 tests passing**: Confirmed refactoring maintains functionality and fixes save/load issues

### 18. Player Character Identification Enhancement ✅
- **Problem solved**: Using symbol '@' to identify player character was fragile and wouldn't work with multiple characters
- **Solution implemented**: Added `isPlayer` boolean field to Character class for robust player identification
- **New architecture**:
  - `Character` constructor now accepts `isPlayer` parameter (defaults to false)
  - Player character created with `isPlayer = true` in GameState
  - Save system serializes/deserializes `isPlayer` field
  - Load system finds player character using `char.isPlayer` instead of `char.symbol === '@'`
- **Benefits achieved**: Future-proof for multiple characters with same symbol, robust player identification
- **All 276 tests passing**: Confirmed enhancement maintains functionality and improves system reliability

### 19. Comprehensive Test Suite Review and Enhancement ✅
- **Problem solved**: Existing unit tests needed updates for character system changes and save/load functionality
- **Solution implemented**: Comprehensive test review and enhancement covering all new functionality
- **New test files created**:
  - `dungeonLevel.test.js`: Tests for character management methods (addCharacter, getCharacterAt, moveCharacter, etc.)
  - `gameState.test.js`: Tests for player position methods with new character system
  - `saveSystem.test.js`: Comprehensive tests for save/load functionality including serialization/deserialization
- **Updated existing tests**:
  - `character.test.js`: Added tests for new fields (symbol, x, y, isPlayer) and moveTo method
  - `world.test.js`: Updated to use new character system instead of old playerPosition
  - `world.js`: Updated placeItems/placeFurniture to use getCharacterAt instead of playerPosition
- **Test coverage achieved**: 276 tests passing, comprehensive coverage of character system, save/load, and all existing functionality
- **Benefits achieved**: Robust test coverage ensures reliability, catches regressions, validates new features work correctly
